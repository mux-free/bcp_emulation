Here I keep functions that have become surplus to requirements, but that contain pieces of code that are not contained in other documents and just deleting the script (and therefor possibly lossing the code) would be too painful.

The functions that lie here with the piece of code I didn't want to get rid off:

- plot_functions.py
    This function plots the cross-section and it also is capable of predicting below-cloud cooling based on manually set thesholds.
    It was used when thresholds were selected using edge-detection and hand-picked threshold based on box-blot analysis served as thresholds for this endevour.

    Possible valuable peice of code: 
        Based on threshold plot stippling
